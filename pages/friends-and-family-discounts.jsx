                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      If you are booking up to 180 days prior to the date of departure of
                      the tour, you may hold rooms and cabins for as many as 10 friends
                      and family for up to 30 days from the date you initiate and pay a
                      deposit on your booking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you are booking between 179 and 90 days prior to the date of
                      departure of the tour, you may hold space for 21 days.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you are booking between 89 and 60 days prior to the date of
                      departure of the tour, you may only hold space for 7 days.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      At 60 days or less prior to departure, space can no longer be
                      reserved. Once the space is booked, let your friends and family
                      members know that they have only a limited time to complete their
                      reservation with guaranteed space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      After 30 days (or 21 days if booking between 179 and 90 days prior,
                      or 7 days if booking between 89 and 60 days prior), any unsold rooms
                      and cabins will be automatically released.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On the release date, if at least 50% of the space has been reserved,
                      you may call to request additional time to offer the remaining space
                      to additional friends and family.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      After 60 days, all unsold space will be released. At any time, a
                      Friends & Family program may be promoted without space being
                      guaranteed. Valencia Travel Cusco reserves the right to recall any
                      unsold space, at any time, with 7 daysâ€™ notice.
